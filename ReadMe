This repository contains a simple budgeting assistant built with JavaScript to help track and manage a startupâ€™s financials. The tool records initial capital, monthly revenue, and expenses, then calculates key financial indicators such as monthly cash flow, current balance, and overall profitability status. This project serves as an introduction to using JavaScript expressions, variables, and primitive data types to represent and manipulate financial and status information in a business context. It demonstrates the foundational skills needed to build logic-driven tools for real-world budgeting and financial tracking.
